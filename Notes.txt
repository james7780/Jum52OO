Reading keypad(s):

1. 5200 will do a keyboard IRQ every 32 scanlines if a key is held down (?)
	- bit 6 of IRQST set to 0
	- IRQST is latched, only reset by write to IRQEN
	- Do interrupt (after next instruction) if IRQEN & 0x40
2. Bit 0 and 1 of CONSOL select which of 4 keypads are being read
	- Bit 2 enables/disables the joystick pots (enable = 1)
3. KBCODE bits 1 to 4 hold the "scan code" from the selected keypad
	- Bit 6 is the "top" fire button state (also causes BRK key interrupt)
	- Bit 0 is always 1 ?
	- "loose bit" (bit 5 of KBCODE) - fluctuates 0 or 1 randomly
	- If no keys pressed, then KBCODE should return 0x1F or 0x3F
 
5. Pitfall (and others) wait for KBCODE = 0x19 to start ((scan code 0xc << 1) | 1)


From https://atarihq.com/danb/files/52analog.pdf:
"The top side buttons on the selected controller act like the 400/800 shift keys and also cause a BREAK-key interrupt, if that’s enabled. Bit 0 of SKCTL, the
debounce enable bit need not be set in the 5200.

A couple of notes about the 5200 keypad:
1. Not only is the debounce enable not needed, if you do enable it you won’t be
able to read any keycodes back from the POKEY.
2. Since the low bit and high bit of the keyboard scan counter are not used any
keypress will actually return 4 different keycodes during each scan cycle. For
this reason it’s always a good idea to mask bits 1-4 before using them.
3. SKCTL bit 2 (last key still pressed) does not behave as expected on the 5200.
I have not yet determined it’s actual behavior.
4. SKCTL bit 1 enables the keyboard scanning. Note that this also
enabled/disables the POT scanning. "
